### Hi there 👋🏼
Here you can find much of the work I do in my free time. Outside of GitHub, I am an Electrical Engineering student, member of several boards/committees/councils and a local [hackerspace](https://revspace.nl), starting freelance dev, fan of rail travel, and aspiring advocate of clean technology and efficient infrastructure and living.

* 🔭 I'm currently working on (mostly for-fun) projects in Dart/Flutter, Go, TypeScript, PHP/Yii, Bash
* 🛠️ I'm also comfortable working with Docker, GitHub Workflows, Deno, Vue/Nuxt, PlatformIO, C, C++, VHDL, Python, and in both backend and frontend development
* ⚡ Recent/current projects I'm happy with:
  * My study association's [app](https://github.com/hoco-etv/flutter-etv-app), my first Flutter project, and its [website](https://etv.tudelft.nl)+API
  * The [MCH2022 badge project](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-project)
    * A WebUSB [Client Library](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-webusb-lib) for the MCH2022 badge
    * A [WebIDE](https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-webusb-site) for the MCH2022 badge using WebUSB
  * [Leakbook](https://github.com/Pwuts/leakbook) ([website](https://facebooklekcheck.nl)), a fun project I did to learn Deno
  * [Techtesters.eu](https://techtesters.eu), for which I did a UI redesign and the implementation in Wordpress
* 🚧 Projects I would like to spend more time on:
  * [RecordJuggler](https://github.com/RecordJuggler), a project with friends to build a jukebox from scratch
  * My portfolio website
