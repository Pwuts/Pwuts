### Hi there üëãüèº
Here you can find much of the work I do professionally as well as past hobby/community projects. In daily life, I work at [AutoGPT] as one of its founding engineers. Outside of work and GitHub, I am an Electrical Engineering ~~student~~ dropout, member of several boards/committees/councils and a local [hackerspace](https://revspace.nl), freelance dev and consulting system architect, fan of rail travel, and aspiring advocate of clean technology and efficient infrastructure and living.
